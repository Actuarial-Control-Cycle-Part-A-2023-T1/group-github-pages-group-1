----------------------------------------------
## **Executive Summary**

The actuarial team at MAIVE Consulting have been tasked with designing a social insurance program for relocation. With the threat of climate change becoming apparent around the globe, Storslysia, who are no exception to the reality of climate-related catastrophes, would like our firm to help manage its exposure to displacement risk due to catastrophice weather events. 

The team has outlined three core principles that its program should adhere to. Specifically, that the benefit payable:
* Should be strictly greater for proactive relocation than for reactive relocation, to ensure incentivisation of the former. 
* Will scale based on the wealth of each household, in the social interests of Storslysia's society.
* Will vary based on the risk inherent to each household at a region level.


## **Program Description** 
MAIVE Consulting recommends that a citizen of Storslysia will be eligible to file a claim under the scheme by default. The citizen can then elect either a proactive or reactive cover.

Each cover will provide a catastrophic relief payment, as well as the following extras: transport fees; coverage for tools of trade, not including home office equipment; provision of temporary accommodation; two Íùî50 vouchers per adult ‚Äì redeemable at select businesses, including but not limited to restaurants, furniture storage, furniture removal; and a free subscription to a mental health program (valued Íùî1000 per person). 

A key aim behind this program is to offer adequate support to residents relocating to a new area - whether that be financial support, or help managing after-effects of a natural disaster, for example, psychological impacts. 

The catastrophic relief payment, unlike the above extras, vary between the proactive and reactive covers.

In accordance with the control cycle, this program will be monitored by MAIVE Consulting monthly over the short-term period of the first year. This frequency will ensure that, as the program is introduced into practice, any initial inefficiencies can immediately be adjusted to improve program performance. The regularity of monitoring will then shift to a quarterly review over the next 2 years, before transitioning to biannually over the following 5 years, and finally annually thereafter for a period of 20 years.

## **Pricing** üòÆ
We forecasted Storslysia's GDP and population and built our proposed program to identify costs associated utilising our [R Script](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-Part-A-2023-T1/group-github-pages-group-1/blob/main/R%20Script).

This script also includes sensitivity analysis performed, and summary statistics to ensure the proposed program costs do not exceed 10% of Storslysia's GDP. 

-----------------------------------------------

## **Results** üòé
The total costs of our program from 2020 - 2100 in the worst case scenario is shown below. From our analysis, our proposed program costs will not exceed 10% of GDP.

Comparing the economic costs with and without our program, we notice that with our program there is reduction in economic costs in the future as well as a decrese in variance.
